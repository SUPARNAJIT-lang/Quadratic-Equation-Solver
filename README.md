# Quadratic Equation Solver

A Python-based tool to solve quadratic equations of the form **y = axÂ² + bx + c**. This program calculates the discriminant, finds the roots (if they exist), and plots the quadratic curve along with its roots.

## Features

- Calculates the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots.
- Computes real roots (if they exist).
- Plots the quadratic curve and highlights the roots on the graph.
- Option to save the graph as an image file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python "Quadratic Equation Solver.py"
